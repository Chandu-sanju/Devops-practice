There are 5 stages are involved during server bootup.
			stage 1 : BIOS
			stage 2 is MBR
			stage 3 is GRUB
			stage 4 is Kernel and 
			stage 5 is runlevel or targets
			
Satge one BIOS full form of BIOS is Basic input output system.
	this stage purly belongs to Hardware.
	
==> post(power on self test) it is a first pogram which we trigger as soon as power on the server.
	==> post does the helth check up of all the hardware components which are connected to server.
 it pop up or give error messages incase any hardware
	component is not functioning or not working properly. 
    ==> once after post program CMOS pogram will execute and it load critical information 
back to main memory like date and time, ram information and all.

 ==> then BIOS program will identify the first priority boot device and pass 
     control to MBR once it find OS. 
now control at MBR it is stage 2. MBR full form is Master boot recorder. 
	==> MBR stores in first sector of boot device.
	==> the sector capacity is 512 bytes.
	==> MBR maintaince the next stage information 
that is GRUB informaiton.
	==> MBR pass control to next stage once it finds the valid GRUB.	
Now control at GRUB it is stage 3. GRUB full form is Grand unified boot loader

GRUB : GRUb contain kerenel image if we have multiple kernel images installed
   on our system we can change . the default kernel images using grub it contains information regarding kernel& initrd images
   
  Now control at Kernel stage that is stage 4.

	==> Kernel Loads the modules and drivers with help of initramfs and initrd programs.
		these initrd and initramfs files will be in /boot directory.
	==> Initramfs is temporary / file system which contains library and configuration files
 which will help to load drivers and modules.
	==> then / file system will mount in read only mode once after load driver and modules.
	==> then executes the systemd program once after mount / file system in read only mode.

now control at target stage. this is last stage here all the start up programs 
will start parlelly and gives login pages.

======================================================================================================================
	interview questions in booting procedure:
	
	1. what is the first process of Linux machine
		systemd in rhel 7 & 8
		initd in rhel 5 & 6
	2. what is the process id of systemd  or initd
		1
		
	3. what is initramfs?
		initramfs is a temparary / file system.which contains libraries and configuration files.

*****   4.boot loaders?
	LILO= Linux loader (rhel 4)
	grub = grand unified boot loader (rhel 5,6)  (grub-install /dev/sda)
	grub2 = grand unified boot loader version 2(RHEL 7,8) ( grub2-install /dev/sda)

	how to reinstall mbr in hard disk?
		grub2-install /dev/sda 
		
What is LILO?
Ans. LILO stands for Linux Loader and is a boot loader to load the operating system in the main memory.
     LILO has no interactive command interface and it  does not support booting from a network. 
	 Lilo is the old default bootloader and GRUB is the new default boot loader
GRUB VS LILO

1) Lilo stands for Linux Loader and GRUB stands for Grand Unified Bootloader.

2) LILO has no interactive command interface, whereas GRUB has a more powerful command interface.

3) LILO does not support booting from a network, whereas GRUB does.

4) GRUB is a boot loader which can be used in Linux, DOS, and other operating systems whereas Lilo is a boot loader for Linux.

5) Lilo has a simpler interface so it is easy to use whereas GRUB is more complicated to use.

6) Lilo is the old default bootloader and GRUB is the new default boot loader.
