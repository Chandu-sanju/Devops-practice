                                      Patching procedure===== Manual procedure=================================

	step 1 :	we will join in the schedule meeting  and collect prechecks and
			 also create snapshot for scheduled servers.
			uname -r;df -h;cat /etc/os-release;pvs;vgs;lvs;uptime;date;cat /etc/fstab commands output
			we will create snapshot for scheduled servers.

	step 2 :  	we will ask monitoring team to disable the alerts for scheduled servers.

	step 3 : 	we will request db and app team to stop the application and db.

	step 4 : 	we will do sanitory reboot of server once after db/app teams 
			confirm application and db is down. 
			rebooting the server before patching. 
			 server is up = server is in good condition before patching
			server is not coming up = some issue in server before patching it self.
	Step 5 : 	will make sure server is registered with satellite if it's redhat system or
			 suma manager if server is suse.
		if server is registered then we will proced and perform patching

	step 6 : using yum update command for redhat machines
		zypper update for suse machines.
	
		it's takes min 15 to 30 min to complete the patching.
	step 7 : we will reboot the server once after patching 

	step 8 : we will do post validation like verifying kernel version, 
		file systems and all then hand over server to app/db teams to start application.

	step 9 : application and db team start the application and confirm us the status
	
	if application is working as expected then we will logoff from meeting and close CR.

 roll back incase app/db team saying something is not working as expected 

			1. merge the snapshot which we created before patching
			2. boot with old kernel
			3. roll back the full patch using yum history undo
			
===========================================================================
patching
every one will join in call
make sure server backup is done
create snapshot for full machine
collect the prechecks
disable or supress the alerts
request db/app team to stop the things whaterver is running
perform sanity reboot
once server is up
check is the server is integrated with satelite 
subscription-manager --status
if server is integrated with satellite then perform patching
	if it is rhel yum update quaterly we will do full patch (3 months once)
	if it is suse zypper update
reboot the server
do post checks
looks fine then hand over to team for application start and validation

============================Naveej Sir====================================
testing on production server
get apporoval
notification/communication
need access to rhel 7.9 rpm files 
configure the repositories (/etc/yum.repos.d) to get packages from rhel 7.9 repository
yum update
reboot
validate
start the application
