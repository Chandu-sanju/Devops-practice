What is Kdump?
• Kdump is an utility used to capture the system core dump in the event of 
system crashes.
• These captured core dumps can be used later to analyze the exact cause of 
the system failure and implement the necessary fix to prevent the crashes in 
future.
• Kdump reserves a small portion of the memory for the secondary kernel 
called crashkernel.
• This secondary or crash kernel is used the capture the core dump image 
whenever the system crashes.

PACKAGE:  koexec-tools
/boot/grub2/grub.cfg – grub configuration file ( /etc/default/grub ) to upadete grub conf ==> grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
• /etc/kdump.conf – kdump configuration file
• /var/crash - default location where vmcore file is generated
• Kdump – service name
• Crash - utility is used to analyze the core file captured by kdump.
  if sys ram => below 512 -- no need to allocate ( that is the rescue case)
             => ram 512M to 2G ---- 64M
			 => above 2g --128M
			 => above 4g --- 256 M
PROCESS :
 step 1: INSTALL THE REQUIRED PACKAGE
      yum install kexec-tools
 STEP 2: EDIT THE /ETC/DEFAULT/GRUB FILE FOR SETTING CRASHKERNEL=128m IF SYSTEM RAM HAS 2GB
 STEP 3; RUN THE GRUB2-MKCONFIG -O ----- FOR UPDATING THE GRUB CONF FILE
 not mandatory : REBOOT THE SYSTEM ( CHECK DMESG | GREP KERNEL )
 STEP 5 : EDIT THE KUDMP CONF FILE (/ETC/KDUMP.CONF )
         no need tochange default path if want we can change ,, and change mkdumpfile -c flag comment above dumb file line default to reboot
 STEP 6: START THE KDUMP
 STEP 7 : if we want check it vmcore image is generate or not we can check by using sysrq 
          sysrq is a magic key .. it wont corrupt our filesystem ifwe has halt may be fs will be corrupted 
		  0=> disable sysrq
		  1=> enable all functons
		  16=> sync
		  s=sync
		  c=crash
	echo 1 > /etc/
