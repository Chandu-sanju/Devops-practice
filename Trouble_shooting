Clear yum cache
The following command ensures that no issues exist relating to corrupted metadata files, missing references, or temporarily free up disk space.

yum clean all
Check for missing repositories
Run the following command to ensure there are no missing repositories.

yum repolist all
You can also verify this inside the /etc/yum.repos.d folder. You can then install any missing repositories with the yum install command or add a file manually into the /etc/yum.repos.d folder.

Check for disabled repositories
If the necessary repositories are available but not working, perform the following steps to edit the repository file:

Run the following command replacing [filename] with the repository filename and [extension] with the respective extension:

cat [filename].[extension]
Open the repository file in the editor of your choice and change the value enabled=0 to enabled=1.

Run the following command to update the package list and install the software:

yum update
Troubleshoot a PycURL error
Several different types of errors might display if the repository file is corrupted. For example, if the yum install command fails with the following error, it might be due to an incorrect repository URL, as shown in this example:

[Errno 14]  - "The requested URL returned error: 403"  
Trying other mirror.
Correcting the repository URL in the repository file and cleaning the yum cache should fix this issue.

yum clean all
Additionally, you can use the yum clean metadata command to clear the metadata cache if any additional XML files caused the corruption.

Troubleshoot a Fatal error, run database recovery error
If yum fails with a Fatal error, run database recovery message, you should delete the database and manually rebuild it by using the following commands:

rm -f /var/lib/rpm__db*
rpm -rebuilddb
yum clean all
yum update
Check for dependency conflicts
If you can’t install a package because of a missing dependency or mismatched version, manually installing each dependency might fix this issue. Additionally, deleting and reinstalling the local package might resolve version mismatches.

Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for most dependency issues because of the many factors involved. In those cases, consider adding a repository that contains the correct dependency.
