for git configuration
what is git :
git is nothing but we can say it is golbal folder here we can access all global files ..but problem is when access the file we not sure
 it is orginal file or not so we have to overcome that whenever access the git file we must do first git pull so we can get orginal file
 process :
 in command prompt:
       => go to cd .ssh/ => ls -lrt //cat uname_dneg.pub and copy the ssh key
 in browser :
 go to chrome => and enter stash/ for land on bitbucket => log in 
  then => manage accounts => ssh key=> add key => past the key 
 then go => projects => select tech => select sites-cfg-systems file => clone it and copy the url

then go command prompt => give cd and mkdir git => then git dir => use git pull (paste url) 
==> done
