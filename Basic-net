TCP and UDP 
TCP : Transmission control protocol
     tcp is connection-oriented protocol , connection orientation means that the communication devices should establish a connection before transimitting the data
	 and should close the connection after transmitting the data,, in tcp relaibilty as it gurarntees of delivery of data to the destination...
	 ex : http,ftp,telnet
	 
UDP : user datagram protocol
     udp is connectionless protocol and datagram-oriented protocol because there is no need to opening a connection ,mainitaning a connection and terminating
    a connection . udp is efficient for brodcast and multicast types of network transmission..the delivery of data is not guranted..
    ex : dns,dhcp, 
  tcp is slower than udp because of reliablity and acknowledgement segemnt

Protocol: 
A protocol is the set of rules or algorithms which define the way how two entities can communicate across the network 
and there exists different protocol defined at each layer of the OSI model.
IP ADDRESS: IS LOGICAL ADDRESS
The length of an IPv4 address is 32-bits, hence, we have 232 IP addresses available. The length of an IPv6 address is 128-bits
MAC Address (Media Access Control address): PHYSICAL Address
A MAC address is assigned to the NIC at the time of manufacturing LENGTH (48 BITS)
Port: 
A port can be referred to as a logical channel through which data can be sent/received to an application. Any host may have multiple applications running, and each of these applications is identified using the port number on which they are running. 
A port number is a 16-bit integer, hence, we have 216 ports available
RANGE -0 TO 65536
Socket: 
The unique combination of IP address and Port number together are termed as Socket. 
Routing: 
The network layer protocols determine which route is suitable from source to destination. This function of the network layer is known as routing.



OSI ( OPEN SYSTEMS INTERCONNECTION) refernce model:
The 7 layers are:-

Application layer
presentation layer    
session layer
Transport layer----------------------(HEART OF OSI)
Network Layer
data link layer(dll)
Physical layer
*****************
1. Physical Layer (Layer 1) :
The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices. 
The physical layer contains information in the form of bits. It is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next. 
When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer,
2. Data Link Layer (DLL) (Layer 2) :
The data link layer is responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the message. 
The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another, over the physical layer. 
When a packet arrives in a network, it is the responsibility of DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC address.  
* Packet in Data Link layer is referred to as Frame.
** Data Link layer is handled by the NIC (Network Interface Card) and device drivers of host machines.
*** Switch & Bridge are Data Link Layer devices.
* Segment in Network layer is referred to as Packet
3. Network Layer (Layer 3) :
The network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. 
It also takes care of packet routing i.e. selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from the number of routes available. 
The sender & receiver’s IP addresses are placed in the header by the network layer
* Network layer is implemented by networking devices such as routers. 
4. Transport Layer (Layer 4) :
The transport layer provides services to the application layer and takes services from the network layer.
The data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments. It is responsible for the End to End Delivery of the complete message. 
The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and re-transmits the data if an error is found.
The services provided by the transport layer :  

A. Connection-Oriented Service: It is a three-phase process that includes 

– Connection Establishment 
– Data Transfer 
– Termination / disconnection 
B. Connectionless service: It is a one-phase process and includes Data Transfer. In this type of transmission, the receiver does not acknowledge receipt
of a packet. This approach allows for much faster communication between devices.
 Connection-oriented service is more reliable than connectionless Service.
 
5. Session Layer (Layer 5) :
This layer is responsible for the establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, authentication, and also ensures security. 
6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6):
The presentation layer is also called the Translation layer. The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network. 
The functions of the presentation layer are :TRANSLATION, ENCRIPTION/DECRIPTION COMPRESSION
7. Application Layer (Layer 7) :
At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, we find the Application layer which is implemented by the network applications. 
These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network.
This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access the network and for displaying the received information to the user. 
**Application Layer is also called Desktop Layer.  

================================> TCP/IP Model<==============================
It is 4 layer model...
Process/Application Layer
Host-to-Host/Transport Layer
Internet Layer
Network Access/Link Layer

1. Network Access Layer –
This layer corresponds to the combination of Data Link Layer and Physical Layer of the OSI model. 
It looks out for hardware addressing and the protocols present in this layer allows for the physical transmission of data.
it as a protocol of Internet Layer or Network access layer. It is described as residing in layer 3, being encapsulated by layer 2 protocols.
