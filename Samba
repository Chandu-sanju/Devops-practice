samba ==> 
  centralized network file system. file system will be in network. we can share across unix to windows and windows to unix.
	sharing can possible cross platforms
		unix to windows
		windows to Unix
	The samba s/w suite is a collection of programms that implements on server message block (smb) protocol in unix system. 
      this protocol also reffered as CIFS(commomn internet file system )...

   	    pkg		:  samba,samba-common,samba-client,cifs-utils,key-utils
		port numbers	: 137,138,139 (Linux side) windows (445)
		service		:smb
		daemon		: smbd  nmbd
		config file	: /etc/samba/smb.conf
 ports :
   137/tcp => nbname => netbios name service
   138/udp => nbdatagram => netbios datagram service
   139/tcp => nbsession => netbios session service
 daemon :
  smbd  => this daemon provides the filesharing and printing services to smb clients
  nmbd => this daemon provides netbios name service and browsing support.
  =========================================================
  Important commands :
  to set samba paswd: smbpasswd -a username
  to see samb passwds  => pdbedit -wL   (stores in /var/lib/samba/private/passdb.tdb)
  to see samba shares : smbclient -L //ipddr/ -NAME
  to access samba share like ftp => smbclient //ip/ -U username
  to access samba share like nfs =>  mount -t cifs //ip/ localmountpoint -o username=username    (cifs = common internet file system)
  we cant shrae directory in samba only files we can share......

  linux machine want to access windows file system here 445 should allow linux machine. that means 445 should listen at windows.


    
scenario 1 : export file system in windows and access it from Linux box.
	how to know the already exported file systems in windows machine.
	windows key  + r   ==> to open run prompt in winodw
			\\localhost

		right click on directory ==> share with ==> particular people ==> add ==> everyone ==> permissions ==> share
	create 1 user in windows machine and set password for him. 
		why this user required?
			using this user only we are going access windows file system from linux box.
	how to create user in windows?
		right click on my pc(my computer) ==> manage ==> local users and groups ==> double click on users ==> right click ==>new user	
ipconfig ==> vmnet8 
how to disable firewall in windows
windows key +r  type control     ==> control pannel ==> system and security ==> windows firewall ==> turn windows firewall on/off ==> 

	Linux side
		accessing windows file system from linux machine
		step 1 : do the connectivity test
			ping <windows ip>
		step 2 : create local directory and mount windows share
			mkdir /b23share
		mount -t cifs //192.168.145.1/b23-sharedrive  /b23share -o username=babu,password=test123
	perm :  add file system details in /etc/fstab file
		//192.168.145.1/b23-sharedrive   /b23share    cifs   defaults,username=babu,password=test123  0  0

	in above entry there is security voilation that is username and password. any body can see these entries. so we have hide credetnails.

	how to hide the credentials
		as a root create file inside secure place (/root). it's a root user home directory only root will have permissions to enter here.
			vi /root/.cre
				username=babu
				password=test123
		chmod 700 /root/.cre
    note: make sure cifs-utils pkg is installed
	add the entry in fstab file
		//192.168.145.1/b23-sharedrive   /b23share    cifs   defaults,credentials=/root/.cre  0  0

cifs = common internet file system
