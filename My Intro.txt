User getting trying to login remote macchine and he his getting permission denied error through ssh How can we trouble shoot

1. Check SSH Key Configuration:
Ensure SSH Key Exists: Verify that the SSH key pair (private and public keys) is correctly set up on the local machine.
On the local machine, check if the private key exists: ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa (or the name of your key).
If the key doesn't exist, generate one using: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com".
Correct Permissions: The permissions on the SSH key files must be correct:
Private key: chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
SSH directory: chmod 700 ~/.ssh
Add SSH Key to the SSH Agent: Ensure that the SSH key is added to the SSH agent.
bash
Copy code
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
2. Verify the SSH Key on the Remote Machine:
Check Authorized Keys: Ensure that the public key is correctly added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote machine.
You can manually add it using: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@remote_host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
Correct Permissions: The permissions on the authorized_keys file and the .ssh directory on the remote machine should be:
.ssh directory: chmod 700 ~/.ssh
authorized_keys file: chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
3. Check SSH Configuration:
SSH Config on Local Machine: Review the SSH config file (~/.ssh/config) for any misconfiguration.
SSH Config on Remote Machine: Verify the SSH server configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) on the remote machine.
Ensure PasswordAuthentication is set to no if you're using key-based authentication.
Ensure PubkeyAuthentication is set to yes.
4. Check User Permissions:
Correct Username: Ensure you're using the correct username when trying to SSH into the remote machine.
User Permissions: Verify that the user has the necessary permissions to access the remote machine.
5. Firewall and Network Configuration:
Port Blocking: Ensure that port 22 (default SSH port) is open and not blocked by a firewall.
IP Restrictions: Check if there are any IP restrictions on the remote machine that might block access.
6. Verbose Output for More Information:
Run the SSH command with the -v flag to get detailed output that can help diagnose the issue:
bash
Copy code
ssh -v user@remote_host
7. Server Logs:
Check SSH Logs: On the remote machine, check the SSH logs for any errors.
For most Linux systems, this is in /var/log/auth.log or /var/log/secure.
If these steps don't resolve the issue, the verbose output or SSH logs might provide more insight into the specific cause of the "permission denied" error.








While using yum you are getting repository error how can you trouble shoot.


1. Check Internet Connectivity:
Ensure that the system has a stable internet connection. You can test this by pinging a reliable server, e.g., ping google.com.
If you're using a proxy, make sure the proxy settings are correctly configured.
2. Verify Repository Configuration:
Check the repository configuration files located in /etc/yum.repos.d/. Each repository has its own .repo file.
Open the .repo file using a text editor (e.g., vi /etc/yum.repos.d/your-repo.repo) and verify:
Base URL: Ensure that the baseurl is correct and accessible.
GPG Key: Ensure that the gpgkey URL is correct.
3. Clear and Rebuild YUM Cache:
Clear the YUM cache to eliminate any corrupted or outdated metadata:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum clean all
Rebuild the cache by running:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum makecache
4. Disable Problematic Repositories:
If a specific repository is causing the issue, you can temporarily disable it:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum --disablerepo=repo-name update
Alternatively, disable the repository by editing the .repo file and setting enabled=0.
5. Check for Repository URL Accessibility:
Use curl or wget to test if the baseurl from the .repo file is accessible:
bash
Copy code
curl -I http://baseurl.example.com/repo/path
If the URL is not accessible, there might be an issue with the server or network blocking access.
6. Verify GPG Key:
If the repository uses a GPG key for package signing, ensure that the key is correctly installed and accessible:
bash
Copy code
sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-your-repo
You can also disable GPG key checking temporarily to see if that resolves the issue:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum --nogpgcheck update
7. Check for Proxy Issues:
If you're behind a proxy, make sure that yum is configured to use it. You can set the proxy in /etc/yum.conf:
bash
Copy code
proxy=http://your.proxy.server:port/
proxy_username=your_username
proxy_password=your_password
Ensure that the proxy allows access to the repository URLs.
8. Check SELinux and Firewall Settings:
If SELinux is enabled, it might be blocking yum from accessing the repositories. You can temporarily disable SELinux to test:
bash
Copy code
sudo setenforce 0
Check firewall settings to ensure that they are not blocking access to the repository URLs.
9. Update YUM:
Ensure that yum itself is up to date by running:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum update yum
This might resolve any issues related to bugs or incompatibilities in the yum tool.
10. Review Logs for Detailed Errors:
Check the logs in /var/log/yum.log for more detailed error messages that can help identify the issue.
11. Try a Different Mirror:
Some repositories have mirror lists (mirrorlist), and one mirror might be down. Try changing the mirror in the .repo file.
12. Contact Repository Maintainers:
If the repository is third-party, check the provider's website or contact them for any issues with the repository server.
By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve most repository errors encountered while using yum.
