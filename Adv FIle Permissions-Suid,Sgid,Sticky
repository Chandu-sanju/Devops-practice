Advanced File Permissions :

ACl => Access control list
By configuring ACl we can assign special permissions on a file for particular user/group irreespective of normal file permissions.


how to check => getfacl filename 
how to assign => setfacl -m user:$usrname:permissions filename  -m -- modify
How to remove => setfacl -x  user:name filename
how to remove all => setfacl -b filename
how to copy from one to another => getfacl filename | setfacl --set-file= filename

If you apply acl permissions on a folder, you need to remember the below concpets
-R => it will recursively applicable for all the inside files and folders
-d => it will inherit the permssions to the future files as well.
