DHCP : dynamic host configuration protocol (port client : 67 and server 68 )
 is a network protocol used for assigning ip addresses to the network clients dynamically from the pre defined ip pool..
 it is usefull for LAN network but not generally used for production servers.dhcp works on the concept of lease amount of time 
 WHAT IS IP ASSIGNMENT PROCESS OF DHCP? also we can called it dora process
 
 => when a client system starts, if it is configured get an ip address from dhcp
 => client computer send a discovery broadcost request on network
 => dhcp recives the request and send an Offfer packet to client
 => client recives the offer packet and send another request packet for assign his ip address 
 => dhcp sends ip address to client and sends ack packet
